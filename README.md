# Project2: WHO DIS?
## Description
User story: `As a new developer, I want an app which can be used to help “break the ice”, so that I can get to know my fellow developers better`.
This application requires a user to create a log-in account. Then the application displays some questions for user to answer. When user completes answering questions, answers will be stored in a database. At the end, all questions and answers from your group/team will display. This application is a great tool to know your members and can be used as an icebreaker.

## Installation
Visual Studio (VS) code and the MySQL Workbench applications are needed.
To set up the database in MySQL, the user should run the `schema.sql` in their MySQL application. For demonstration purposes, the user may also use the questions created and contained in the `seeders` folder, titled `questionInterFace.js`. To seed the database the user will run the command `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all`.
To run the application via VS code, the user must run the following commands: `npm init` and `npm i mysql` to install the necessary `package-lock.json` and `node_modules`. Once the installs are complete, the application may be run via the following command: `node server.js`.
The application is also deployed to Heroku and may be accessed via the following link: https://peaceful-citadel-50333.herokuapp.com/
